Analyzing Production Trends in a Manufacturing Company

Project Background
Museli AG operates in the breakfast cereal market as a German based manufacturer. The company can use up to six different ingredients in it's production: wheat, oats, nuts, raisins, strawberries, and blueberries. There are six product SKUs the manufacturer can produce including Original, Raisin, Nut, Blueberry, Strawberry and Mixed Fruit museli. In the simulation game, our task as Team C is to achieve the highest company valuation amongst all other participating teams. This valuation is based on the sales and profit margins of the products sold. Key business decisions affect the production productivity levels to produce the finished museli SKU at the right time intervals.

Insights and reccomendations for effective production are as follows:
- High production throughput by measuring the confirmed quantity of material
- Analyze the procurement levels to ensure the right amount is ordered
